  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - - Memoize parsed document string result and use
  it wherever possible, and export `getDocumentString` function to allow users to use it as well.
  - Use `WeakMap`s with `DocumentNode` wherever possible instead of using LRU Cache with strings. It
    is more optimal if a parser caching is used

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `onResolverCalled`

  We decided to drop onResolverCalled hook and instead
  [provide a new plugin](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/pull/1500) that will let you hook into
  this phase.

  ```diff
  import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'
  import { envelop, Plugin, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
  + import { useOnResolve } from '@envelop/on-resolve'

  +   onPluginInit: ({ addPlugin }) => {
  +     addPlugin(useOnResolve(onResolverCalled))
  +   },
    }
  }

  const getEnveloped = envelop({

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `useAsyncSchema` plugin

  This was a mistake from beginning as we cannot asynchronously validate and parse since with

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `graphql` as a peer dependency

  We have built the new `envelop` to be engine agnostic. `graphql-js` is no longer a peer
  dependency. Now you can use any spec compliant GraphQL engine with `envelop` and get the benefit
  of building a plugin system. We have introduced a new plugin that can be used to customize the
  GraphQL Engine.

  ```diff
  - import { envelop } from '@envelop/core'
  + import { envelop, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
  + import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql';

  - const getEnveloped = envelop([ ... ])
  + const getEnveloped = envelop({ plugins: [useEngine({ parse, validate, execute, subscribe })] })

  ```

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `enableIf` utility in favor of more type
  safe way to conditionally enable plugins. It wasn't a great experience to have a utility

  + import { envelop, useMaskedErrors } from '@envelop/core'
  import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    parse,
    validate,
    execute,
    subscribe,
    plugins: [
      // This plugin is enabled only in production
  -    enableIf(isProd, useMaskedErrors())
  +    isProd && useMaskedErrors()
    ]
  })
  ```

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `handleValidationErrors` and

  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Removed orchestrator tracing

  `GraphQLSchema` was wrapped to provide resolvers/fields tracing from the schema. Issue with this
  approach was it was very specific to the underlying engine's implementation. With the new version
  we no longer want to depend to a specific implementation. Now users can wrap their schemas and add
  tracing themselves.

  Thanks [@viniciuspalma](https://github.com/viniciuspalma)! - Adding tslib to package dependencies

  Projects that currently are using yarn Berry with PnP or any strict dependency resolver, that
  requires that all dependencies are specified on package.json otherwise it would endue in an error
  if not treated correct

  Since https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers is currently being used, tslib should
  be exported as a dependency to external runners get the proper import.

  export const useMyHook = (): Plugin => {
    return {
      onPluginInit(context) {
        context.registerContextErrorHandler(({ context }) => {
          console.error(
            'Error occurred during context creation but at least I have the  context so far',
            context
          )
        })
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

  - @envelop/types@2.2.0

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d5115b4: allow masking validation and parse errors with `useMaskedErrors`.

  ```ts
  useMaskedErrors({
    handleParseErrors: true,
    handleValidateErrors: true
  })
  ```

  This option is disabled by default as validation and parse errors are expected errors that help
  the API consumer instead of leaking secret information.

  If you want to avoid leaking schema suggestions, we recommend using persisted operations.

- d5115b4: add `setResult` to `AfterValidateEventPayload` for altering the validation errors.

### Patch Changes

- ada7fb0: correctly identify introspection only operations in `useImmediateIntrospection`
- Updated dependencies [d5115b4]
  - @envelop/types@2.1.0

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 78b3db2: Add `setResultAndStopExecution` to the `onSubscribe` context.

### Patch Changes

- f5eb436: always invoke `onExecutDone` hooks

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- aac65ef: Move `onResolverCalled` from within `OnExecuteHookResult` and `OnSubscribeHookResult` to
  the `Plugin` type.

  ```diff
  import type { Plugin } from "@envelop/core";

  const plugin: Plugin = {
    onExecute() {
  -    return {
  -      onResolverCalled() {}
  -    }
  -  }
  +  },
  +  onResolverCalled() {},
  }
  ```

  We highly recommend avoiding to use any plugins that use `onResolverCalled` within your production
  environment as it has severe impact on the performance of the individual resolver functions within
  your schema.

  The schema resolver functions are now ONLY wrapped if any plugin in your envelop setup uses the
  `onResolverCalled` hook.

  If you need any shared state between `onExecute` and `onResolverCalled` you can share it by
  extending the context object.

  ```ts
  import type { Plugin } from '@envelop/core'

  const sharedStateSymbol = Symbol('sharedState')

  const plugin: Plugin = {
    onExecute({ extendContext }) {
      extendContext({ [sharedStateSymbol]: { value: 1 } })
    },
    onResolverCalled({ context }) {
      const sharedState = context[sharedStateSymbol]
      // logs 1
      console.log(sharedState.value)
    }
  }
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 4106e08: Add new option `breakContextBuilding` to `OnContextBuildingEventPayload`.

  This allows short-circuiting the context building phase. Please use this with care as careless
  usage of it can result in severe errors during the execution phase, as the context might not
  include all the fields your schema resolvers need.

- 4106e08: Add new plugin `useImmediateIntrospection` for speeding up introspection only operations
  by skipping context building.

  ```ts
  import { envelop, useImmediateIntrospection } from '@envelop/core'
  import { schema } from './schema'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [
      useSchema(schema),
      useImmediateIntrospection()
      // additional plugins
    ]
  })
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4106e08]
- Updated dependencies [aac65ef]
  - @envelop/types@2.0.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 3dfddb5: Bump graphql-tools/utils to v8.6.1 to address a bug in getArgumentsValues

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d9cfb7c: Support including the original error stack for masked errors within the error extensions
  via the `isDev` option and the `defaultErrorFormatter`.

  ```ts
  useMaskedErrors({ isDev: true })
  ```

  On Node.js environments the `isDev` default value is `true` if
  `globalThis.process.env["NODE_ENV"]` is equal to `"development"`. Otherwise, the default value is
  ALWAYS `false`.

  ***

  The `FormatErrorHandler` now has a third argument `isDev` which is forwarded from the
  configuration and can be used for customizing the formatter behavior in development mode.

## 1.6.6

### Patch Changes

- 8e365c2: fix potential memory leak when using `onEnd` and `onNext` stream handlers for hooking
  into `subscribe` and `execute`.

  This has been caused by AsyncGenerators being blocked until the next value is published. Now
  disposed result streams (AsyncIterables) will properly cleanup the underlying stream source.

- fd14339: feat(usePayloadFormatter): add second argument with execution arguments

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 521ecb8: Prefer `globalThis.performance.now` for tracing if available. Fallback to `Date.now`.

  Using tracing no longer raises an error on browser, deno and cloudflare worker environments.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- f272b28: useTiming: Fix a typo in onSubscriptionMeasurement

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- b1a0331: Properly list `@envelop/core` as a `peerDependency` in plugins.

  This resolves issues where the bundled envelop plugins published to npm had logic inlined from the

### Minor Changes

- eb0a4bd: Adds a custom message option used when masking errors

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7704fc3: Add API for registering a context creation error handler.

  ```ts
  export const useMyHook = (): Plugin => {
    return {
      onPluginInit(context) {
        context.registerContextErrorHandler(({ error, setError }) => {
          console.error('Error occurred during context creation.', error)
          setError(new Error('Something went wrong :('))
        })
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- 7704fc3: `useMaskedErrors` now masks errors thrown during context creation (calling
  `contextFactory`).

  It might be possible that you need to load some data during context creation from a remote source
  that could be unavailable and thus yield in an error being thrown. `useMaskedErrors` now handles
  such scenarios and prevents leaking such information to clients.

  ✅ context error will be masked

  ```ts
  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [
      useExtendContext(() => {
        throw new Error('Oooooops.')
      }),
      useMaskedErrors()
    ]
  })
  ```

- 7704fc3: useMaskedErrors now also handles errors that are occurring during subscriptions.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7704fc3]
  - @envelop/types@1.1.0

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 35c85a7: ensure legacy graphql execute parameters are passed properly.

  ```ts
  // deprecated (removed in GraphQL.js 16)
  execute(schema, ...args)
  // how it should be done
  execute({ schema, ...args })
  ```

  This fixes an edge-case with graphql frameworks that call execute with the old and deprecated
  signature.

  Thus, Envelop allows developers using server frameworks that hard-core the legacy v15 call
