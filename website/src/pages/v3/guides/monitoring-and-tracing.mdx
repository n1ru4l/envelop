# Monitoring and Tracing

If something is not working as it should within your GraphQL server you would not want it to go unnoticed. Envelop has a wide variety of plugins for different error tracking and performance monitoring services.

## Sentry

Sentry is the biggest player regarding error tracking within JavaScript land. With the [`useSentry` plugin](/plugins/use-sentry) any error can be tracked with a proper context, containing important information for tracking down the root cause of the error.

As with any other envelop plugin, the setup is straight forward!

```ts
import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useEngine({ parse, validate, execute, subscribe }),
    // ... other plugins ...
    useSentry()
  ]
})
```

## DataDog, InfluxDB, Telegraf, StatsD

You can use `useStatsD` plugin to collect and send metrics to Datadog's DogStatsD and InfluxDB's Telegraf StatsD services.

[Learn more about the `useStatsD` plugin](/plugins/use-statsd).

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a possible alternative for Sentry that allows tracking errors as exceptions. [Learn more about the `useOpenTelemetry` plugin](/plugins/use-open-telemetry).

## Prometheus

Prometheus is a platform for scraping metrics from services and utilities. You can use `usePrometheus` plugin to expose and collect metrics from all phases of your GraphQL execution.

[Learn more about the `usePrometheus` plugin](/plugins/use-prometheus).

## New Relic

If you wish to integrate NewRelic for tracing, monitoring and error reporting, you can use [`useNewRelic`](/plugins/use-newrelic) plugin.

![Example NewRelic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1ru4l/envelop/HEAD/packages/plugins/newrelic/error_operation.png)

As with any other envelop plugin the setup is straight forward!

```ts
import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
import { useNewRelic } from '@envelop/newrelic'

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useEngine({ parse, validate, execute, subscribe }),
    // ... other plugins ...
    useNewRelic({
      // ...
    })
  ]
})
```

[Learn more about the `useNewRelic` plugin](/plugins/use-newrelic).

## Apollo-Tracing

Apollo introduced the apollo-tracing specification and implemented it in apollo-server. With envelop it is possible to use apollo-tracing for tracking down slow resolvers with any server.

```ts
import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
import { useApolloTracing } from '@envelop/apollo-tracing'

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useEngine({ parse, validate, execute, subscribe }),
    // ... other plugins ...
    useApolloTracing()
  ]
})
```

Also, if you are using GraphQL Playground as part of your setup, you'll be able to see the tracing information under `TRACING` section:
