## Plugins Lifecycle

Plugins are executed in order of their usage, and inject functionality serially, so aim to keep your plugins simple and standalone as much as possible.

The `before` functions are called in order, and then the `after` function of each hook will be called in the same order, when the phase has done.

The basic API allow you to keep the JS closure between `before` and `after`, for example:

```ts
const myPlugin = {
  onParse({ params }) {
    // This is the before function

    return ({ result }) => {
      // The is the after function,
      // JS Closure allow me to access the params here as well
    };
  },
};
```

> All plugins lifecycle methods are executed in LIFO order (Last-in, First-out) to make timing more consistent.

### The improved `context`

While in regular GraphQL executions, the `context` is built right before `execute` happens, in `envelop` we allow plugin developers to take part it that context from all phases.

While calling `getEnveloped` function (the result of `envelop({ plugins: [ ... ]}))`, you can pass any custom object that will be the base for your GraphQL execution `context`.

In most cases, you'll pass the incoming HTTP request (or, just the relevant parts of it) to make it available for the plugins you use:

```ts
import { envelop } from '@envelop/core';

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    /* ... plugins ... */
  ],
});

myHttpServer.on('request', async req => {
  const { parse, validate, contextFactory, execute, schema } = getEnveloped({ req });
  // ...
});
```

Plugins might also use this `context` to keep a contextual reference for objects they might need across stages.

So for example, if you wish to make some data from `parse` stage available for you in `execute` phase, you can extend the context while running `onParse` and then access that data in `onExecute`:

```ts
const myPlugin = {
  onParse({ extendContext }) => {
    extendContext({
      myVar: 'test'
    });
  },
  onExecute({ args }) => {
   const myVar = args.contextValue.myVar;
  },
};
```

## Plugins API

You can find the [complete signature for plugins API here](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop/blob/d4c8f90f9fbccf3032b3b3b05f359b691076d25b/packages/types/src/index.ts#L55).

### `onPluginInit(api)`

This method is called only once when the plugin is being initialized. This hook is triggered only once, and is useful for setting up the plugin.

**API**:

- `setSchema` - sets the initial schema to be used.
- `plugins` - list of all other loaded plugins.
- `addPlugin` - adds a plugin to the list of plugins.

### `onEnveloped(api)`

This method is called every time `getEnveloped` is called, and per request. This is useful if you need to do some setup right before an incoming execution flow.

**API**:

- `setSchema` - sets the initial schema to be used.
- `context` - the initial context object passed to `getEnveloped`, including the context built by plugins that ran before.
- `extendContext` - extends the initial context object with additional fields.

### `onParse(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed.

**`before` API**:

- `params` - the original parameters passes to `parse` function.
- `parseFn` - the current `parse` function. By default, it's the one from `graphql` package.
- `setParseFn` - Replaces the `parse` function with a custom function.
- `setParsedDocument` - sets the parse result. Setting this will skip calling `parse` for the executed operation.
- `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

**`after` API**:

- `result` - the result `DocumentNode` of the parsing function.
- `replaceParseResult` - replaces the parsed result.
- `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

### `onValidate(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed.

**`before` API**:

- `params` - the original parameters passes to `validate` function.
- `validateFn` - the current `validate` function. By default, it's the one from `graphql` package.
- `setValidationFn` - Replaces the `validate` function with a custom function.
- `addValidationRule` - Adds a validation rule to the list of default validation rules (as defined in `graphql` package).
- `setResult` - sets the validation result. Setting this will skip calling `validate` for the executed operation.
- `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

**`after` API**:

- `valid` - A boolean indicates if the validation passed.
- `result` - `null` in case of valid document, otherwise an array of validation errors.
- `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

### `onContext(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed. Used for building the GraphQL context incrementally.

**`before` API**:

- `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

**`after` API**:

- `context` - the eventual built context, by all plugins.
- `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

### `onExecute(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed. The return value of this function is extended, and allow you to hooks into resolver calls if needed.

**`before` API**:

- `args` - arguments passes to `execute` (contains the document, variables and everything else that needed for executing the GraphQL operation)
- `executeFn` - the `execute` function to use, by default it's the one from `graphql` package.
- `setExecuteFn` - replaces the `execute` function.
- `setResultAndStopExecution` - sets the result of the execution immediately. Calling this function will stop execution.
- `extendContext` - allow you to extend the context before executing the operation.

You can return an `object` from that function, with the following fields:

**`onExecuteDone` API**:

Triggered when the execution of the operation is done.

- `result` - the execution result.
- `setResult` - replaces the result. can either be with data or errors.

**`onResolverCalled` API**:

Triggered when a resolver is called during the execution of the operation.

- `params` - an object with `{ root, args, context, info }` that was originally passed to the resolver.

You can also return a function to run after the resolver is done, with the following API:

- `result` - the resolver return value.
- `setResult` - replaces the resolver return value.

### `onSubscribe(api)`

Called every time a `subscription` operation is being executed. The return value of this function is extended, and allow you to hooks into resolver calls if needed.

**`before` API**:

- `args` - arguments passes to `subscribe` (contains the document, variables and everything else that needed for executing the GraphQL operation)
- `subscribeFn` - the `subscribe` function to use, by default it's the one from `graphql` package.
- `setSubscribeFn` - replaces the `subscribe` function.
- `extendContext` - allow you to extend the context before executing the operation.

You can return an `object` from that function, with the following fields:

**`onSubscribeResult` API**:

Triggered when subscription result is being emitted from a `subscription` execution.

- `result` - the subscription result.
- `setResult` - replaces the result. can either be with data or errors.

**`onResolverCalled` API**:

Triggered when a resolver is called during the execution of the operation.

- `params` - an object with `{ root, args, context, info }` that was originally passed to the resolver.

You can also return a function to run after the resolver is done, with the following API:

- `result` - the resolver return value.
- `setResult` - replaces the resolver return value.

### `onSchemaChange(api)`

`envelop` allow you to manage a reference to a schema, that you can later access and use within your server.

Some plugins (like gateway implementations) could potentially change the schema while running, so `envelop` will trigger that event in case of a schema change _after all plugins have initialized_.

**API**:

- `schema` - the `GraphQLSchema`
- `replaceSchema` - replaces the schema. Calling this will trigger `onSchemaChange` for all other plugins (except for the one that initiated the change);
